# py_get_drop
Retrieve and archive locally files from Dropbox on a Pi

This is a basic script to automatically download files from specific Dropbox
directories and then rsync them with multiple archives.

I use this to import cameraphone photos to both the main PC where
editing/printing and such occur and simultaneously the backups of that
collection.
This ensures that the file has been copied to multiple locations before it
is deleted from Dropbox to free up space on Dropbox.
